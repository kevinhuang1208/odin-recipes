        <li>3/4 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 tablespoon of ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 tablespoon of salt</li>
        <li>1/8 tablespoon of ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of lemon juice</li>
        <li>6 thinly sliced, peeled apples</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Place 1 pie crust in ungreased 9-inch glass pie plate. Press firmly against side and bottom.</li>
        <li>In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate. Top with second crust. Wrap excess top crust under bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal; flute. Cut slits of shapes in several places in top crust.</li>
        <li>Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
