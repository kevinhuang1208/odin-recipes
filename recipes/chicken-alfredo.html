    <ol>
        <li>Bring a quart (950 ML) of water in a large pot to a boil over high heat, and salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta for 8 minutes, or until slightly underdone.</li>
        <li>Add broccoli to pasta and simmer for 4 minutes with the lid on.</li>
        <li>Strain the pasta and broccoli in a colander, and run cold water over to prevent the broccoli from over cooking.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in the pot over medium-high heat, and add the chicken. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked through, remove it from the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to the pot, and melt it. Once the butter is fully melted, add in garlic and stir continuously for 10 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the heavy cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir often, and cook until sauce starts to bubble slightly.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce is bubbling and begins to cook down, add in Parmesan cheese and stir until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Add in the cooked chicken, pasta, and broccoli, and stir until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Top with Parmesan cheese or red chili flakes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the meal!</li>
